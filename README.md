Tired of digging through endless documentation pages and still not finding what you need? That's exactly what Slack Integrations solves - delivering intelligent AI support directly in your Slack workspace, replacing the need for human support engineers entirely.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

While building the Slack Integrations, we will build two separate Python applications:

```bash
.
├── apps / 
|   ├── infrastructure/                 # Docker infrastructure for the applications
|   ├── slack-integrations-offline/     # Offline ML pipeline
└─  └── slack-integrations-online/      # Online inference pipeline
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Find detailed setup instructions in each app's documentation:

| Application | Documentation |
|------------|---------------|
| Offline ML Pipelines  </br> (data pipelines, etl, RAG) | [apps/slack-integrations-offline](apps/slack-integrations-offline) |
| Online Inference Pipeline </br> (Slack Integrations Agentic App) | [apps/slack-integrations-online](apps/slack-integrations-online) |

After completing the Offline and Online pipeline setups, you'll have access to your Agentic app in Slack, as seen in the video below:

## 💰 Cost Structure

The project is open-source and free! You'll only need <$0.5 for tools if you run the code:

| Service | Maximum Cost |
|---------|--------------|
| OpenAI's API | ~$0.5 |
