  1. Deploying ZenML



# Connect

Various means of connecting to ZenML.

Once ZenML is deployed, there are various ways to connect to it.

CI/CD or long‑lived automation calling the ZenML Pro management API (`cloudapi.zenml.io`)

ZenML Pro service account + API key

Long-lived API key

Connect with a ZenML Pro service account

Which base URL should you call?

  * Workspace/OSS API: your server or workspace URL (e.g., `https://<workspace-id>.zenml.io`).

  * ZenML Pro management API: `https://cloudapi.zenml.io`.




In ZenML Pro, use Personal Access Tokens or organization‑level service accounts and API keys (workspace‑level service accounts are deprecated). PATs and org‑level service accounts can be used for both the Workspace API and the Pro management API. See ZenML Pro Personal Access Tokens and ZenML Pro Organization Service Accounts.

## 

Common pitfalls

  * 401 Unauthorized: verify you’re using the correct base URL, the token hasn’t expired, and the header is `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

  * Automation fails after 1 hour: check the expiration date of the PAT or API key and rotate it if it has expired.

  * Can’t find Run Template endpoints: they exist on the Workspace/OSS API, not on `cloudapi.zenml.io`.
