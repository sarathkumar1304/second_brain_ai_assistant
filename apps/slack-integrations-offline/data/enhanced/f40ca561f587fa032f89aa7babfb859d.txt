Check out our tutorial on scheduling for a practical guide on how to schedule a pipeline.

### 

Set a schedule

Copy```
from zenml.config.schedule import Schedule
from zenml import pipeline
from datetime import datetime
@pipeline()
defmy_pipeline(...):
  ...
# Use cron expressions
schedule =Schedule(cron_expression="5 14 * * 3")
# or alternatively use human-readable notations
schedule =Schedule(start_time=datetime.now(), interval_second=1800)
my_pipeline = my_pipeline.with_options(schedule=schedule)
my_pipeline()
```


Check out our SDK docs to learn more about the different scheduling options.

### 

Update/Pause/Stop a schedule

You can update or delete your schedules using the following CLI commands:

Copy```
# Update the cron expression of the schedule
zenml pipeline schedule update <SCHEDULE_NAME_OR_ID> --cron-expression='* * * * *'
# Delete a schedule
zenml pipeline schedule delete <SCHEDULE_NAME_OR_ID>
```


The functionality of these commands changes depending on whether the orchestrator that is running the schedule supports schedule updates/deletions:

  * If the orchestrator supports it, this will update/delete the actual schedule as well as the schedule information stored in ZenML

  * If the orchestrator does not support it, this will only update/delete the schedule information stored in ZenML




If the orchestrator **does not** support schedule management, maintaining the lifecycle of the schedule is the responsibility of the user. In these cases, we recommend the following steps:

  1. Find schedule on ZenML

  2. Match schedule on orchestrator side and delete

  3. Delete schedule on ZenML

  4. Re-run pipeline with new schedule




A concrete example can be found on the GCP Vertex orchestrator docs, and this pattern can be adapted for other orchestrators as well.
