  1. Getting Started



# Installation

Installing ZenML and getting started.

1

**Install ZenML**

ZenML currently supports **Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13**. Please make sure that you are using a supported Python version.

Base package

Local Dashboard

Jupyter Notebooks

**ZenML** is a Python package that can be installed using `pip` or other Python package managers:

Copy```
pipinstallzenml
```


Installing the base package only allows you to connect to a deployed ZenML server. If you want to use ZenML purely locally, install it with the `local` extra:

Copy```
pipinstall'zenml[local]'
```


If you want to use the ZenML dashboard locally, you need to install ZenML with the `server` extra:

Copy```
pipinstall'zenml[server]'
```


If you want to run a local server while running on a Mac with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4), you should set the following environment variable:

Copy```
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```


You can read more about this here.

If you write your ZenML pipelines ins Jupyter notebooks, we recommend installing ZenML with the `jupyter` extra which includes improved CLI output and logs:

Copy```
pipinstall'zenml[jupyter]'
```


2

**Verifying Installations**

Once the installation is completed, you can check whether the installation was successful either through Bash or Python:

Bash

Python

Copy```
zenmlversion
```


Copy```
import zenml
print(zenml.__version__)
```


If you would like to learn more about the current release, please visit our PyPi package page.

## 

Running with Docker

`zenml` is also available as a Docker image hosted publicly on DockerHub. Use the following command to get started in a bash environment with `zenml` available:

Copy```
dockerrun-itzenmldocker/zenml/bin/bash
```


If you would like to run the ZenML server with Docker:

Copy```
dockerrun-it-d-p8080:8080zenmldocker/zenml-server
```


## 

Starting the local server

By default, ZenML runs without a server connected to a local database on your machine. If you want to access the dashboard locally, you need to start a local server:

Copy```
# Make sure to have the `server` extra installed
pipinstall"zenml[server]"
zenmllogin--local# opens the dashboard locally 
```


However, advanced ZenML features are dependent on a centrally deployed ZenML server accessible to other MLOps stack components. You can read more about it here. For the deployment of ZenML, you have the option to either self-host it or register for a free ZenML Pro account.
