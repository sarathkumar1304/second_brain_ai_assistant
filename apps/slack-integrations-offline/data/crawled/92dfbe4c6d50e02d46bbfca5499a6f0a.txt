  1. Deploying ZenML
  2. Connect



# with your User (programmatic)

Connect to the ZenML server using a Personal Access Token.

If you are using ZenML Pro and need to call the ZenML Pro workspace API from a non-interactive environment, you also have the option of creating and using a Personal Access Token. Personal Access Tokens are scoped to your ZenML Pro user account and can be used to access all workspaces you are a member of in any organization. See the ZenML Pro Personal Access Tokens documentation for more information.

**Personal Access Tokens are only available in ZenML Pro**

If you are using ZenML OSS and need to call the ZenML OSS API from a non-interactive environment, you can use a service account and an API key. See the Connect with a service account documentation for more information.
