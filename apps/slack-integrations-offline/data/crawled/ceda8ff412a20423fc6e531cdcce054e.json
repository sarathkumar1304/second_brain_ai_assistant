Reference\n\n\n\n# FAQ\n\nFind answers to the most frequently asked questions about ZenML.\n\nThis page addresses common questions about ZenML, including general information about the project and how to accomplish specific tasks.\n\n## \n\nAbout ZenML\n\n#### \n\nWhy did you build ZenML?\n\nWe built it because we scratched our own itch while deploying multiple machine-learning models in production over the past three years. Our team struggled to find a simple yet production-ready solution whilst developing large-scale ML pipelines. We built a solution for it that we are now proud to share with all of you! Read more about this backstory on our blog here.\n\n#### \n\nIs ZenML just another orchestrator like Airflow, Kubeflow, Flyte, etc?\n\nNot really! An orchestrator in MLOps is the system component that is responsible for executing and managing the execution of an ML pipeline. ZenML is a framework that allows you to run your pipelines on whatever orchestrator you like, and we coordinate with all the other parts of an ML system in production. There are standard orchestrators that ZenML supports out-of-the-box, but you are encouraged to write your own orchestrator in order to gain more control as to exactly how your pipelines are executed!\n\n#### \n\nCan I use the tool `X`? How does the tool `Y` integrate with ZenML?\n\nTake a look at our documentation (in particular the component guide), which contains instructions and sample code to support each integration that ZenML supports out of the box. You can also check out our integration test code to see active examples of many of our integrations in action.\n\nThe ZenML team and community are constantly working to include more tools and integrations to the above list (check out the roadmap for more details).\n\nMost importantly, ZenML is extensible, and we encourage you to use it with whatever other tools you require as part of your ML process and system(s). Check out our documentation on how to get started with extending ZenML to learn more!\n\n#### \n\nWhich license does ZenML use?\n\nZenML is distributed under the terms of the Apache License Version 2.0. A complete version of the license is available in the LICENSE.md in this repository. Any contribution made to this project will be licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0.\n\n## \n\nPlatform Support\n\n#### \n\nDo you support Windows?\n\nZenML officially supports Windows if you're using WSL. Much of ZenML will also work on Windows outside a WSL environment, but we don't officially support it, and some features don't work (notably anything that requires spinning up a server process).\n\n#### \n\nDo you support Macs running on Apple Silicon?\n\nYes, ZenML does support Macs running on Apple Silicon. You just need to make sure that you set the following environment variable:\n\nCopy```\nexport OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES\n```\n\n\nThis is a known issue with how forking works on Macs running on Apple Silicon, and it will enable you to use ZenML and the server. This environment variable is needed if you are working with a local server on your Mac, but if you're just using ZenML as a client / CLI and connecting to a deployed server, then you don't need to set it.\n\n## \n\nCommon Use Cases and How-To's\n\n#### \n\nHow do I contribute to ZenML's open-source codebase?\n\nWe develop ZenML together with our community! To get involved, the best way to get started is to select any issue from the `good-first-issue` label.\n\nPlease read our Contribution Guide for more information. For small features and bug fixes, please open a pull request as described in the guide. For anything bigger, it is worth posting a message in Slack or creating an issue so we can best discuss and support your plans.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I add custom components to ZenML?\n\nPlease start by reading the general documentation page on implementing a custom stack component, which offers some general advice on what you'll need to do.\n\nFrom there, each of the custom stack component types has a dedicated section about adding your own custom components. For example, to add a custom orchestrator, you would visit this page.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I mitigate dependency clashes with ZenML?\n\nCheck out our dedicated documentation page on some ways you can try to solve these dependency and versioning issues.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I deploy cloud infrastructure and/or MLOps stacks?\n\nZenML is designed to be stack-agnostic, so you can use it with any cloud infrastructure or MLOps stack. Each of the documentation pages for stack components explain how to deploy these components on the most popular cloud providers.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I deploy ZenML on my internal company cluster?\n\nRead the documentation on self-hosted ZenML deployments, in which several options are presented.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I implement hyperparameter tuning?\n\nOur dedicated documentation guide on implementing this is the place to learn more.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I reset things when something goes wrong?\n\nTo reset your ZenML client, you can run `zenml clean` which will wipe your local metadata database and reset your client. Note that this is a destructive action, so feel free to reach out to us on Slack before doing this if you are unsure.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I create dynamic pipelines and steps?\n\nPlease read our general information on how to compose steps + pipelines together to start with. You might also find the code examples in our guide to implementing hyperparameter tuning which is related to this topic.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I use templates and starter code with ZenML?\n\nProject templates allow you to get going quickly with ZenML. We recommend the Starter template (`starter`) for most use cases, which gives you a basic scaffold and structure around which you can write your own code. You can also build templates for others inside a Git repository and use them with ZenML's templates functionality.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I upgrade my ZenML client and/or server?\n\nUpgrading your ZenML client package is as simple as running `pip install --upgrade zenml` in your terminal. For upgrading your ZenML server, please refer to the dedicated documentation section, which covers most of the ways you might do this as well as common troubleshooting steps.\n\n#### \n\nHow do I use a specific stack component?\n\nFor information on how to use a specific stack component, please refer to the component guide, which contains all our tips and advice on how to use each integration and component with ZenML.\n\n## \n\nCommunity and Support\n\n#### \n\nHow can I speak with the community?\n\nThe first point of contact should be our Slack group. Ask your questions about bugs or specific use cases, and someone from the core team will respond.\n\nPreviousMCP Docs & llms.txtNextGlobal settings\n\nLast updated 2 months ago\n\nWas this helpful?\n",
